<h1>Grilled Cheese </h1>
    <img src="recipe_images/grilledcheese.jpg">
<p><strong>u/writergeek</strong>If we're talking strictly grilled cheese, not melts, I like using a quality sourdough. Mayo instead of butter for frying it up. I'll eat any cheese really, but my favs are a creamy havarti, smoky gouda or really sharp cheddar.</p>
<p><strong>u/travio</strong>My grilled cheese secret is encrusting the sides of the sandwich with cheese. After cooking each side to just under the browning I want, I pick up the sandwich and sprinkle some cheese on the pan, placing the sandwich back down on the cheese. The cheese browns tastily, sticking to the bread, and providing a lovely extra crunchy texture.</p>
