    <h1><strong>Lasagna</strong></h1>
    <img src="recipe_images/lasagna.jpeg" alt="lasagna">
    <p><strong>u/drays:</strong>Hand made super thin pasta sheets, and at least 20 layers, alternating between a b√©chamel spiked with parmesan cheese, a rich ragu of oxtail white wine and onion, garlic basil pesto, and (thin) layers of shredded mozzarella. The top should be a thin layer of perfect tomato sauce and then crisp bubbly browned mozzarella goodness. The whole thing ends up 5-6" thick, and if you've done it right and all your sauces are the right consistency it will slice and stand on the plate like a piece of layer cake, but without being dry or crumbly, and the tomato sauce will flow down the sides in little rivulets.
    It's not a very 'authentic' lasagna, but it sure is tasty. And incredibly labour intensive. </p>
    <p><strong>u/Tablemonster:</strong>Bad. You all suck. I'm on a phone and drunk so bear with me.

        You don't need to par cook a damn thing unless you want lasagne noodles that disintegrate and fall to shit, doing nothing but disappoint. Put your raw hard-ass noodles in a pan of lukewarm water before you do anything. Make sure they are separated enough do they don't stick to each other. By the time you're ready to use them they'll be perfect for the oven.
        
        One pound ground beef. One pound ground Italian sausage. One large finely chopped onion. A bunch of minced garlic( everyone knows how much is good ) One 6 oz can tomato sauce About 4 oz tomato paste One 10-12oz can chopped tomatoes
        
        After browning and draining the meat add the chopped onions and garlic. Cook it a bit till they are cooked and add all the tomato shit. Slow cook this stuff and add your dried herbs(basil, marjoram, thyme, salt and pepper) I believe if you don't know how to work dried herbs you have no place in a kitchen so take it as you will.
        
        As the sauce mixture is cooking take a full 16 oz full milk ricotta (part skim is for pussies) and beat in: Two full eggs Two teaspoons of salt ( I prefer coarse kosher) 1/4 cup chopped Italian flat leaf parsley Let that shit sit
        
        So you have your huge ass bag of shredded mozzarella right? And your brick of Parmesan hmm? Good. Make sure you also have a can of sprinkle parm, some asiago, and some Romano.
        
        Now for the fun. I personally use a deep 9 x 13 glass casserole dish, well greased with olive oil. Do what you will. This also works foe two of the smaller foil pans if you are lazy or going to a pot luck or whatever
        
        Sauce, noodles(lightly patted dry), ricotta mixture, mozzarella with the other cheeses sprinkled liberally on top. Repeat once. Do no make the layers too thin because you don't want to come off as a overly noodly bitch. When you're done cover it with foil(spray with nonstick on the food side) at 350 for 45 minutes. Uncover and cook for 10-15 more minutes.
        
        You're welcome</p>
