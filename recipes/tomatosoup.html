    <p><strong>u/TyvekBacon</strong>Ok this is a farm recipe. I do not know the measurements. Melt about half a stick of butter in a pan. Add enough flour to make a dry looking paste. Add about 3 cups of milk and salt to taste. Peel 3-4 medium sized beef steak tomatoes diced. Cook on med-low untill tomatoes disolve. Check salt levels again. Yumm. You can add a variety of spices, but this is a basic cheap farm soup. Serve with grilled cheese and love ❤️</p>
    <p><strong>u/autofasurer</strong>I cut the tomatoes in half and roast them in the oven first. Really brings out the flavour and is for me the key. The rest is to taste really. For the rest I just sauté an onion/shallot and some garlic. Add the tomatoes, vegetablestock (or beef stock as alternative - I prefer it to chicken stock for tomatosoup), maybe a bayleaf and let it all simmer. Then mix and sieve for smoothness and to get any peel and seeds out.

        You could add some celery if you like, but be sparse as the taste can quickly overtake the tomato. You could also chiffonade some basil to add in the end (but don't add it during the simmering, it will lose its freshness I find).
        
        Really I just go with instinct and don't really have a recipe I use... you could experiment with adding some vanilla, as it pairs well with tomato, but there again moderation is key... Simpler the better.
        
        [Edit: now I feel like tomato soup :) I know what I'll be doing tonight! Picked the last tomatoes of the season last week; in the soup they go!]</p>
